# A robot that follows things.

The bot has three ultrasonic rangefinders on the front, one pointing forward,
one to the left and one to the right, if something comes in the way of the
rangefinders the robot moves towards it.

## Using the code
You will need the Arduino IDE to upload the code to your Arduino.

* Clone or download this repo.
* Open the `following_robot.ino` file in the Arduino IDE.
* Select your board from *tools>board*.
* Upload the code to the board by pressing the Upload button,
  it's the arrow in a circle, at the top left corner of the IDE.


## Building the robot

**Parts:**

* An Arduino.
* 3 ultrasonic rangefinders, I used the HC-SR04.
* A motor driver, I used an L293D.
* 2 DC motors.
* 2 wheels.
* A castor.
* A robot chassis.
* Some standoffs to mount the Arduino and motor driver(optional, you can just
  tape them on to the chassis).
* Cardboard, to mount the three sensors to the front of the robot.
