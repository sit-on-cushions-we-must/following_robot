# A robot that follows things.

The bot has three ultrasonic rangefinders on the front, one pointing forward,
one to the left and one to the right, if something comes in the way of the
rangefinders the robot moves towards it.

**Parts:**

* An Arduino.
* 3 ultrasonic rangefinders, I used the HC-SR04.
* A motor driver, I used an L293D.
* 2 DC motors.
* 2 wheels.
* A castor.
* A robot chassis.
* Some standoffs to mount the Arduino and motor driver(optional, you can just
  tape them on to the chassis).
* Cardboard, to mount the three sensors to the front of the robot.
